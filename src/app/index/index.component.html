    <p class="text-justify">
      The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's personality
      type,
      strengths, and preferences. The questionnaire was developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs based
      on
      their work with Carl Jung's theory of personality types. Today, the MBTI inventory is one of the most widely used
      psychological instruments in the world.

      Based on the answers to the questions on the inventory, people are identified as having one of 16 personality
      types. The
      goal of the MBTI is to allow respondents to further explore and understand their own personalities including their
      likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, possible career preferences, and compatibility with other people.

      No one personality type is "best" or "better" than another. It isn't a tool designed to look for dysfunction or
      abnormality. Instead, its goal is simply to help you learn more about yourself. The questionnaire itself is made
      up of
      four different scales.

    <h5 class="pb-2 pt-5">HOW TO SOLVE THE TEST?</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      There are no "right" or "wrong" answers to the questions on this inventory. Your answers will help
      to show
      how you like to look at things and how you like to go about deciding things. Knowing your own
      preferences
      and learning about other people's can help you understand whether your special strenghts are, what
      kind of
      work you might enjoy and be successful doing, and how people with different preferences can relate
      to each
      other and be valuable to society. Read each question carefully and select one of the two choices
      given,
      which applies to you, by circling to either "A" or "B".
